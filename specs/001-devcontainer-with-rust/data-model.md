# Data Model: Devcontainer With Rust Toolchain

Date: 2025-09-18

This feature does not introduce domain data entities. It provides development environment scaffolding and a minimal runtime artifact (Hello world binary). There are no persistent data models required for this feature.

If future features require persistence (e.g., a database-backed sample app), that will be defined in a follow-up spec and added to the data model.
