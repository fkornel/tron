# Feature Specification: Devcontainer With Rust Toolchain And ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-devcontainer-with-rust`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Devcontainer with rust toolchain and an empty 'Hello world' application."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: devcontainer environment, Rust toolchain availability, starter application
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., collaboration expectations, publishing requirements), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A contributor opens the project in a supported development environment and immediately has a ready-to-use, isolated development workspace containing the Rust toolchain and a minimal runnable "Hello world" Rust application so they can verify tooling setup and begin extending functionality without extra manual setup steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new contributor with only the base tooling required to open dev containers, **When** they open the project using the provided development container configuration, **Then** the environment initializes with the Rust toolchain available and a starter application runnable with a single command.
2. **Given** the prepared environment is launched, **When** the contributor runs the starter application using a clearly communicated standard run action, **Then** it outputs a simple human-readable greeting message exactly once (e.g., "Hello world") without errors.

### Edge Cases
 - What happens when the container fails to provision required language toolchain components? ‚Üí Hard fail (Fail Fast): Container initialization is considered failed; the contributor is blocked until the toolchain installs successfully. The startup should present a clear error message with remediation steps (e.g., retry provisioning, check network).
 - How does system handle a user attempting to run the application before environment initialization finishes? ‚Üí Block runs until an explicit readiness signal is present (Fail Fast): Any attempt to run the starter application before readiness is rejected with a clear `Environment not ready` message and instructions to wait or troubleshoot (e.g., check container logs, retry provisioning).
- What if the greeting text needs localization or customization later? ‚Üí Assumed out of scope for initial feature; future extensibility not specified.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an isolated, reproducible development workspace accessible via a standardized dev container configuration.
- **FR-002**: The environment MUST expose the Rust toolchain so that a basic Rust program can compile and run successfully.
- **FR-003**: A minimal starter application MUST exist that produces a single-line greeting when executed.
- **FR-004**: A contributor MUST be able to perform a single obvious command or action to run the starter application (no multi-step manual setup).
- **FR-005**: The feature MUST enable a new contributor to confirm environment readiness within one minute of first launch under typical conditions (qualitative expectation‚Äîexact performance threshold not provided).
- **FR-006**: Documentation or discoverability MUST indicate how to run the starter application (e.g., via README or equivalent onboarding surface).
- **FR-007**: The workspace MUST avoid including non-essential example code beyond the minimal greeting behavior to reduce noise.
- **FR-008**: The environment MUST support future extension of the starter application without requiring re-creation of the dev container.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide a deterministic initial state so two contributors get equivalent starting behavior.
- **FR-010**: The greeting output MUST be clear and human-readable in plain text.
 - **FR-011**: Environment MUST surface toolchain version information and include a pinned toolchain file (`rust-toolchain` or `rust-toolchain.toml`) that specifies a concrete Rust toolchain version matching the devcontainer image. The repository MUST document the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) and provide upgrade guidance.
 - **FR-012**: The run command MUST be standardized across local development and CI where applicable. The spec assumes basic CI integration is in scope for running the sample app in a smoke-check job; if full CI pipeline integration is not desired, mark this as out-of-scope. Provide a short example CI job that builds and runs the starter application as part of a smoke test.
 - **FR-013**: The output message content MUST remain stable unless intentionally changed. For the initial feature, the exact phrasing should be: "Hello world" (case-sensitive). Any change to this phrasing MUST be documented and justified in a follow-up changelog entry.
