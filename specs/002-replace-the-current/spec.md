# Feature Specification: Replace Hello world CLI with an HTTP web server

**Feature Branch**: `002-replace-the-current`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Replace the current hello world application with a web server which returnes \"Hello World\"."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A client (user or service) makes an HTTP GET request to the application's root path or health endpoint and receives an HTTP response whose body contains the exact text: "Hello World". The response should be successful (HTTP 200) and contain no additional framing or prompts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the web server is running, **When** a client issues an HTTP GET request to `/` (root), **Then** the server responds with status `200 OK` and body exactly `Hello World`.
2. **Given** the web server is running, **When** a client issues an HTTP GET request to `/health` (optional health endpoint), **Then** the server responds with status `200 OK` and body contains `Hello World` (or a clear success marker referencing the same message).

### Edge Cases
- If the server receives a POST or other non-GET method at `/`, the server should respond with a `405 Method Not Allowed` or a 4xx status indicating method is not supported for that path.
- If the server path does not exist, the server should return `404 Not Found`.
- If the server is under load or internal error occurs, it should return `5xx` with a concise error message; the feature does not define retries or backoff.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST listen for HTTP requests on a configurable port (default to `8080`) and accept at least incoming TCP connections bound to localhost inside the container.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST respond to an HTTP GET request to `/` with status `200`, header `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`, and a response body exactly equal to `Hello World` (case-sensitive, without surrounding quotes or additional whitespace).
- **FR-003**: The system SHOULD also expose `/health` which responds with `200` and a small plaintext success body (may be `Hello World`), considered optional but recommended.
- **FR-004**: For unsupported HTTP methods at `/`, the server MUST respond with an appropriate `4xx` status (e.g., `405 Method Not Allowed`).
- **FR-005**: The server MUST log incoming requests and responses at a level sufficient for debugging (log lines are out of scope for acceptance tests but required operationally).

*Resolved ambiguities*
- **FR-006**: Resolved ‚Äî plaintext response required (see FR-002).
- **FR-007**: Resolved ‚Äî TLS is not required for this feature; plain HTTP is acceptable and tests will run against HTTP on the configured port inside the container.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HTTP Endpoint**: Represents the server's routes; attributes include path (`/`, `/health`), method (`GET`), response code, and response body.
