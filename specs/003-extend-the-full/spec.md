# Feature Specification: Extend the full solution with Docker Compose

**Feature Branch**: `003-extend-the-full`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Extend the full solution with docker compose. The goal would be to have an independent frontend project ("frontend" docker image - webserver+index.html+rust wasm) and to have an independent backend project (existing docker image renamed to \"backend\"). Frontend behavior is to establish a REST request to Fetch the \"Hello World\" response and it prints out to the browser's console. (not using Javascript, but full every frondend logic encapsulated in Rust WASM)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or reviewer, I want a Docker Compose setup that runs two independent services ‚Äî a `frontend` (static webserver serving `index.html` and a Rust/WASM bundle) and a `backend` (the existing server image renamed to `backend`) ‚Äî so I can open the frontend in a browser, have the frontend WASM code fetch the backend‚Äôs "Hello World" response, and see that text printed to the browser console.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Docker Compose is running and both services are healthy, **When** the user navigates to the frontend URL, **Then** the page loads, the WASM bundle initializes, it performs a REST GET request to the backend root endpoint `/`, and prints "Hello World" to the browser console.

2. **Given** the backend responds with `200 OK` and `Content-Type: text/plain` body `Hello World`, **When** the frontend fetches it, **Then** the console output shows exactly `Hello World` with no extra whitespace.

3. **Given** the backend is unreachable or returns non-200, **When** the frontend attempts to fetch, **Then** the frontend logs a clear error message to the console.

### Edge Cases
- Slow backend responses should trigger a client timeout and a logged timeout error in the console.
- Backend returning binary or non-UTF-8 should result in a decoding error logged by the frontend.
- WASM initialization failure should log an initialization error without crashing the page.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The repository MUST include a `docker-compose.yml` that defines two services: `frontend` and `backend`.
- **FR-002**: `frontend` MUST be an independent Docker image named `frontend` that serves a static `index.html` and includes a Rust/WASM bundle responsible for client-side logic.
- **FR-003**: `backend` MUST be the existing server image, renamed to `backend`, exposing at least `GET /` which returns the greeting string.
- **FR-004**: The frontend MUST initialize the Rust/WASM runtime on page load and perform a REST GET request to the backend to obtain the greeting without relying on external JavaScript for the fetch logic.
- **FR-005**: The frontend MUST print the exact response body (trimmed) to the browser console upon a successful response.
- **FR-006**: Both services MUST expose a `/health` endpoint returning 200 for readiness checks.
- **FR-007**: The docker-compose setup MUST map ports such that the frontend is reachable at `localhost:<port>` in local development.

*Ambiguities / Clarifications Needed*
- **CL-001**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Confirm the backend endpoint path to call (defaulting to `/`).]
- **CL-002**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Browser minimum version/support requirements for the Rust/WASM bundle.]
- **CL-003**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the frontend include any UI beyond index.html, or is console output sufficient?]

### Key Entities
- **Frontend**: Static site + Rust/WASM bundle; responsible for initiating REST requests and logging results; no persistent storage.
- **Backend**: HTTP server serving greeting responses and a `/health` endpoint.
